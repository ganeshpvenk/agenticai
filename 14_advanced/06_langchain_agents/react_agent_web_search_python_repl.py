# Tools
# A ReAct agent doesn't have any fixed capability of its own beyond

# tools. Two very different kinds here on purpose: one that reaches out
# to the real world (search), one that computes (code execution).

# ReAct prompt, written out explicitly (rather than pulled from LangChain
# Hub via hub.pull("hwchase17/react")) so the actual reasoning loop the
# agent is instructed to follow is visible here, not hidden behind a
# hub lookup. {tools} and {tool_names} get filled in automatically by
# create_react_agent from the tools list above; {agent_scratchpad} is
# where the agent's own prior Thought/Action/Observation steps get
# replayed back to it on each iteration.

Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought->Action->Action Input->Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin!
