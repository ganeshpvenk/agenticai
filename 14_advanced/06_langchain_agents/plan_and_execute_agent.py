# PLAN-AND-EXECUTE
# ReAct decides what to do ONE step at a time, re-thinking after every
# observation, with no commitment to what comes next. Plan-and-Execute
# instead commits to a full ordered list of steps UP FRONT, then works
# through that list - closer to writing a to-do list before starting,
# rather than deciding the next move only after seeing the last result.
# This trades ReAct's ability to course-correct mid-task for a plan
# that's visible and auditable before any tool ever gets called.
