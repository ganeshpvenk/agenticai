# =====================================================================
# GraphRAG: Entity extraction -> Relationship graph -> Graph retrieval.
#
# Plain vector search treats every chunk as an independent bag of
# meaning - it has no notion that "Cashless Claim" and "TPA" and
# "Portability" are the SAME handful of entities showing up across many
# different chunks, connected by explicit relationships. GraphRAG makes
# that structure explicit up front: an LLM extracts (subject, relation,
# object) triples from the corpus once, those triples become a graph,
# and a query is answered by finding the entities it mentions and
# walking the graph outward from them - collecting every fact connected
# to those entities in one traversal, rather than hoping similarity
# search happens to rank them all in the same top-k.
#
# This differs from 14_8_multi_hop_reasoning.py, which chains FACTS
# together with repeated vector searches and no persistent structure.
# GraphRAG instead builds the structure once (the index-time cost) and
# retrieves by traversing it (the query-time payoff).
#
# Knowledge base: a curated subset of the health-insurance statements
# from the shared 50-statement KB - the ones dense with named entities
# and relationships (TPA, portability, waiting periods) that a graph
# can actually connect.
