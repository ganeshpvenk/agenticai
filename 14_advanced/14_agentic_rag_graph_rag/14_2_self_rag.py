# =====================================================================
# Self-RAG: Retrieve -> Evaluate -> Regenerate -> Synthesize.
#
# Corrective RAG (see 14_3_corrective_rag.py) grades the RETRIEVED
# DOCUMENTS and decides where to get context from (KB vs. web search).
# Self-RAG grades the GENERATED ANSWER instead: after drafting a reply,
# it asks "is every claim in this draft actually backed by the context I
# retrieved, and does it fully answer what was asked?" If the draft
# overclaims something the KB doesn't actually support, or leaves part
# of the question unanswered, it regenerates - either with a stricter
# grounding instruction or a follow-up retrieval - before finalizing.
# This catches a failure mode CRAG can't: the retrieved documents were
# perfectly relevant, but the answer still overreached beyond them.
#
# Knowledge base: the same 50-statement insurance policy KB used
# elsewhere in this folder. Both questions below sit right at the edge
# of what the KB actually commits to - a natural first-draft answer is
# likely to round up ("3 years in" -> "yes, covered") or fill a real gap
# in the KB with a plausible-sounding invention, which is exactly what
# the critique step exists to catch.
